# KE-Generator

Python code and exe pack was developed for the calculation of the kenetic evelope of Sydney rail network (Sydney Trains/ARTC/Sydney Metro)

This automated KE program aims to be in feature parity with the spreadsheet, with code written in a manner for integration in other CAD suites that can support Python, as well as the potential expansion of this software to greater accommodate integrated workflows as part of the design process.

- Standards compliant
- Modular architecture allows the user to create their own personal licenses
- Import modules allow the inclusion of most types of measurement data
- Typical rolling stock outlines of Sydney Trains, ARTC, and Sydney Metro, provided by the respective stakeholders was imported
- Calculations of the KE movement were developed according to Asset Standards Authority (ASA) Transite Space, and operator standards
- The ability for future users to create and edit new vehicle models
- Multiple simultaneous run type capability / extensive output data sheets
- Ability to import track design data from Bentleyâ„¢ Railtrack software
- Ability to export KE and KE+200 outlines into any CAD software
